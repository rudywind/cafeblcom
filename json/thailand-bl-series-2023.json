Despite being so different from each other, the two fall in love and are happy.

In the evenings, he would be responsible for small tasks such as delivering items to regular customers whose residences were located on his way home. \n\nOne day, Venus met a new customer, Sky. Sky, an incessantly good-humoured, highly energetic young doctor despite mountains of work at the hospital, is happy to see Venus after so many years and wants to rekindle their friendship. Venus, having been rejected after confessing to Sky three years ago, wants nothing to do with him and does his best to avoid Sky as much as possible.\n\nCan Sky rekindle Venus&#x27; love for him? Can Venus forgive Sky? Time will tell...\n\n(Source: iQIYI; edited by MyDramaList)"
